Project Description: User Registration and Admin Data Viewing System with JavaFX
This project is built using JavaFX to create a comprehensive system where users can register their details and authorized administrators can manage and view this information. The application integrates SQL for robust database management, employing JavaDAO for efficient data access operations. Users are guided through a seamless registration process where they input necessary information like name, email, and other relevant details, with validation to ensure data accuracy. Admins, equipped with privileged access, can securely view, update, and delete user records as needed. The user interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, facilitating easy navigation and efficient data management. By leveraging JavaFX, the project not only ensures a visually appealing interface but also enhances usability, making it a powerful tool for managing user registrations and data securely and effectively.
